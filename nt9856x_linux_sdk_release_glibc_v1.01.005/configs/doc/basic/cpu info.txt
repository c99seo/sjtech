* CPU

Properties:

- compatible : Should at least contain "cortex-a9".

- clock-frequency : To delcare the cpu frequency. This value should be synchronized with loader info.

- cpu-release-addr : SMP will use this address to release the pen

- next-level-cache : Assign to PL310 L2 outer cache phandle pointer

* Timer

We used the cpu core timer and peripheral timer clock info as the following compatible definitions.

Properties:

- compatible : Should at least contain "periph_clk". It will be used as cpu timer

- compatible : Should at least contain "core_clk".

* gic

Properties:

- compatible : Should at least contain "cortex-a7-gic".

- reg : GIC register info

- interrupts : Maintenence IRQ

* pmu

Properties:

- compatible : Should at least contain "cortex-a9-pmu". HW PMU to monitor the system performance.

- interrupt-affinity : CPU core affinity number.

- interrupts : Fill the SPI IRQ number

* Cache

ARM CA9 had an outer cache controller which is named PL310, the following will config related parameters.

- compatible : Should at least contain "pl310-cache".

- arm,data-latency: The L2 cache data latency config

- arm,tag-latency: The L2 cache tag latency config
