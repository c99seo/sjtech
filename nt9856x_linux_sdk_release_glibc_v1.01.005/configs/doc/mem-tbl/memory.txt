* memory

Linux system (Linux OS) memory.

Properties:

- reg : Linux system memory region: address(hex) size(hex)


* reserved-memory

To declare the memory reserved area in Linux system memory.

Properties:

- cma0:
	* compatible: shared-dma-pool (fixed), dma allocate api will use this buffer.
	* reg: to declare the cma area with address and size
	* alignment: 0x400000 (fixed)


- dsp_cma0:
	* compatible: shared-dma-pool (fixed), dsp0 will use this area.
	* reg: to declare the cma area with address and size
	* alignment: 0x400000 (fixed)

- dsp_cma1:
	* compatible: shared-dma-pool (fixed), dsp1 will use this area.
	* reg: to declare the cma area with address and size
	* alignment: 0x400000 (fixed)

* hdal-memory

Hdal memory, also named as media memory zone(MMZ) memory.

Properties:

- media:
	* reg: The MMZ memory range address(hex) size(hex), it contains four values as follows:
		   DDR1 address(hex), DDR1 size(hex), DDR2 address(hex), DDR2 size(hex).
		   If the HW layout does not have DDR2, user can just assign two values: DDR1 address and DDR1 size.
